# Supercipherment
Encrypt and decrypt words using three base encryption algorithms. This project emphasizes on three core ideas: Classic String cipher algorithms, java objects, and polymorphism. 
Superencipherment is the idea of creating secure ciphers by combining many simpler ciphers together. By taking three ciphers and combining them in different ways, we 
can actually create ciphers that are difficult to decrypt. By utilizing polymorphism, I made all three cipher objects subclasses of parent "BaseCipher" class. This allows
us to have BaseCipher variables refer to all three ciphers. <br />

These three algorithms include:
